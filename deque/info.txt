Deque - 
An ADT (Abstract Data Type) that resembles both a stack and a queue

Deque can hold a collection of items and the order is sort of preserved in a deque. You can add items both 
to the front and to the back an you can remove items from the front and back as well. 

Using the deque data structure, write a fuction that takes in an input string and returns true if:
	the string is a palindrome - a word that is the same when spelt backward and forward

 """
Loop thro and add ch to rear of deck for constant time
As long as d's size >= 2, remove front-most and rear-most item into their vars
If those variables aren't equivalent, return early
If the variables are the same, proceed to the next items
If the size of the deck eventually gets to be smaller than 2, return true
